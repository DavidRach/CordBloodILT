The experiment datasheets for each experiment day can be found in this folder. They were scanned into .pdf files from the paper versions on August 24th, 2025. 

The typical format for each pdf is as follows:

Page 1: Thawing data sheet, volume and counts, start of the processing time tracking.
Page 2-4: Continued processing, staining and acquisition time tracking. 
Page 5-6: Dilution/Aliquoting data sheet, derrived from an excel file based on CD45+ count and volume from Page 1
Page 7-8: Antibody Mix and Reagent data sheet
Pag 9-10: Panel by Laser view
Page 11+: Any additional notes (including unmixing). 

The "tidying" of the time tracking data is in progress, and will be shared when complete. Any stain splotches have a high probability of having been coffee <3
